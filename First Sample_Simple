1. Retrieving Data:
retrieve a list of all transactions from a table named "Transactions."

SELECT * FROM Transactions;

2. Filtering Data:
get all transactions of a particular account:

SELECT * FROM Transactions WHERE account_id = 'ABC123';


3. Aggregating Data:
total amount of transactions for a specific account:

SELECT account_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM Transactions
WHERE account_id = 'ABC123'
GROUP BY account_id;

4. Joining Tables:
retrieve a list of transactions with account names:


SELECT T.transaction_id, T.amount, A.account_name
FROM Transactions T
JOIN Accounts A ON T.account_id = A.account_id;

5. Subqueries:
finding accounts with transactions above the average:


SELECT account_id, account_name
FROM Accounts
WHERE account_id IN (
    SELECT account_id
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY account_id
    HAVING AVG(amount) > (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM Transactions)
);

6. Date Manipulation:
filter transactions by specific date ranges. For example, to get transactions within a specific month:


SELECT * FROM Transactions
WHERE transaction_date >= '2023-07-01' AND transaction_date < '2023-08-01';
